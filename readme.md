Hiding and showing HTML on a page, using a set of buttons that you add to the page dynamically. In other words, this is basic DOM Manipulation

The two main parts of this project that I need to complete to get a Meets Expectations grade require me to add buttons to the bottom of the page and show different sets of student information in list of 10 with the last page being 4 students when each button is clicked.
